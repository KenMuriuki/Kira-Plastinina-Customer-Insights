# Project One Description
Customer insights using supervised learning with R. This project aims to predict who is most likely to click on an online advertisement on a kenyan website. The project contains a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis on the variables, identifying the characteristics of the individuals who clicked on the ad and using these characteristics to predict who is most likely to click on the ads. This project has applied four supervised learning algorithms i.e Decision tree, Random Forests, Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines.

# Project Two Description
The unsupervised Learning with R The objective of this project is to perform clustering on different visitors to a website to identify which type of visitors are generating revenue and which visitors are not generating revenue. I applied K-Means and Hierarchical clustering to the data with an aim to identify similarities in the data by different visitors to the website and try segmenting the visitors by these characteristics. This will also be done by grouping the customers with similar characteristics together.
